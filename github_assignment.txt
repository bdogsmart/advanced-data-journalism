I cloned FiveThirtyEight's nfl-elo-game repository for this assignment. This repository holds data from NFL games dating all the way back to 1920. In addition to score archives, the repository also holds the code which generates the win probabilities it gives for every NFL team each week on its website. This data is used in a game feature on the website where users can make predictions against the FiveThirtyEight calculations to see how they do. According to the website, their goal for providing this repository is "for people to be able to figure out how FiveThirtyEight's NFL Elo model and NFL predictions game work and to provide a loose framework for evaluating forecasts against historical data." For me, this stuff is super interesting because I love football and the NFL and coming up with statistical ways of predicting outcomes has always intrigued me. Hopefully, after learning more in this class, I will be able to play around with their code and actually understand more of how they come up with the predictions they make and how the really cool features on their website come to life through writing code.
